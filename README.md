# Curious Contours

A procedural terrain generator that creates contour-style landscapes in real-time using 3D metaballs and marching squares algorithm.

##Live demo: [https://collidingscopes.github.io/curious-contours/](https://collidingscopes.github.io/curious-contours/)

## Features

- Generate unique procedural terrain textures in real-time
- Customize animation speed, complexity, colors, and more
- Export your creations as images or videos
- Completely free and open source (MIT license)

## How it Works

Curious Contours uses 3D spheres (metaballs) that float around and combine with others based on distance. 2D cross-sections are drawn using a Marching Squares algorithm, producing a terrain contour aesthetic.

## Usage

- Use the controls to adjust settings
- Click the randomize button (ðŸŽ²) for new variations
- Save your creations as images (ðŸ“·) or videos (ðŸŽ¥)

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5 Canvas
- dat.GUI for controls
- mp4-muxer for video export
